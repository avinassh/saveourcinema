        <p>The 'Save Our Cinema' coalition was set up to help the Indian movie watching public participate in the policy building process around censorship in the country. The Shyam Benegal committee is finalizing recommendations for a censor board revamp and is asking for public comments. We have created an easy to use tool that helps you send your responses quickly.</p>

        <div class="ui clearing divider"></div>
          <p>Have you recently gone to a movie in India and scratched your head trying to understand what was going on because of all the muted dialogues? For example, in a recently released Hollywood movie which was given 'Adult' rating, all double meaning dialogues were ordered to be replaced with 'Man and Woman', and all instances of the words 'asshole' were ordered to be muted.</p>
          <p>If you are tired of this ridiculous curtailment of the freedom of expression guaranteed in our constitution, there is a ray of hope. The Union Government has constituted a committee headed by Shyam Benegal, one of the most respected film makers in the country to recommend how to revamp the censor board. The committee is asking for views of film viewers on the certification process being followed by the CBFC and suggestions if any within the ambit of the existing Cinematograph Act, 1952, rules and guidelines which have withstood the scrutiny of various courts to help them finalize their recommendations. Submissions should be restricted to two pages and covering important aspects detailed here: <a href="http://www.nfdcindia.com/uploads/post/0241643001452855838.pdf">NDFC Guidelines</a>.</p>

          <u><strong>Dear Committee members,</strong></u>
          <p>As a movie lover and a concerned citizen, I am honoured to present to you my views on the changing needs of the CBFC so that it can better serve its designated purpose.</p>
          <u><strong>Demarcation of authority and staffing:</strong></u>
          <p>With the cases of K. A. Abbas vs Union of India, 1971 and S. Rangarajan etc. vs P. Jagjivan Ram on 30 March, 1989, the Honorable Supreme Court of India has made it amply clear that censorship in movies and of movies is constitutionally valid. This email is not questioning the constitutionality of the CBFC itself, but where its authority should begin and end. When it comes to banning a movie outright, the CBFC should recuse itself and leave the issue to be dealt with by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (I &amp; B from here on). CBFC’s main purpose should be to certify movies and it should not have the authority to decide not to certify it at all and ban it. The decision to ban the movie should be with the I &amp; B and with it alone.</p>
          <p>This brings into light a much broader point on the independence of CBFC. Right now all the members, including the chair, are government appointees. This poses a myriad of logistical issues and leaves open the scope to have conflicts of interest. Right now, neither citizens involved in movie making nor film viewers have any say in how the CBFC is organized and this should change. A committee must be formed under the supervision of the Supreme Court, where members of the Judiciary and civil society together make a decision on the CBFC’s 25 board members, CEO and the Chair. The same process should be followed for regional centers supervised by the respective high courts.  CBFC should be made a truly independent organization and there should be a clear demarcation of where the powers of the CBFC end and where the I &amp; B’s begin. The CBFC should have authority on certification of movies only, while the I&amp;B ministry should have authority on complete censorship of a movie and only regarding complete censorship- it should not have the authority to influence decisions made by CBFC and the certification process and vice versa.</p>
          <p>Once the initial certifying bench clears a movie, the chair of CBFC should use his veto power only once. The chair should return the relevant documents to the original bench, with his/her recommendations, where they are required to clear it again. The chair must clear the film the second time it reaches his/her table.</p>   
          <u><strong>Dual rating for Celluloid &amp; Video:</strong></u>
          <p>CBFC should not rate movies twice (Celluloid and Video) unless there is a significant difference between the two versions. It should be the responsibility of adults to make sure no child has access to them. CBFC should not act as a kind of "moral police" and stop adults from watching movies in the privacy of their homes. Restricting access to movies legally will only increase instances of piracy in this digital age, more so as Indian movies makers are finding it easier to distribute their movies overseas without any restrictions/ censorship. Once the international versions hit the market, it is only a matter of time before they are available on the Internet for the world to see. This is proving to be extremely burdensome to movies makers who are making movies that are being appreciated internationally which many members of this committee are familiar with. There are also severe restrictions that stop A-rated movies from being aired on cable TV. To ease the burden on CBFC, it should be left to the TV channels as they are adept at self-censorship. Indian Broadcasters’ Federation along with EMMC already have the necessary rules and mechanisms in place to make sure the programs they telecast conform to their respective guidelines.  In most international markets, the home video versions of movies have extra content included so that they are much more attractive to buy for consumers. By limiting the rating to only “V/U” and “V/UA” the CBFC is effectively acting as a content filter for movies that get an “A” rating. India is the only major movie market where revenue is so skewed in favor of theaters.</p>
          <u><strong>Public health warnings:</strong></u>
          <p>Although the effort of Ministry of Health in dissuading people from smoking and consumption of alcohol is commendable through warnings, implementation is lacking. The ministry of health needs to come up with a standard design to display the warnings. Rather than using both symbols and written words to display the warning, it is recommended that only symbols be shown while the movie is playing. Symbols evoke a much deeper response than having a combination of words and symbols (Demirbilek 2003). The way they are being shown today on screen is hardly legible and is overall an annoyance for the viewers.</p>
          <u><strong>Spoilers and expletives in censor certificate:</strong></u>
          <p>CBFC needs to be sensitive to potential spoilers when creating the list of recommended cuts. The description of the cuts and changes gives away major plot points. It is recommended that CBFC prepare two versions of the document; one for the creators providing detailed reasons why the cuts and changes were recommended and the other, an abridge version, to be displayed prominently at the theater which contains only the time stamp, clause and duration columns. This also prevents CBFC having to use the words like “Blowjob” (case of The Hateful Eight) and “Suck the Cock,” “Mother Fucker,” “Asshole”(all in the case of Deadpool) from being displayed in public spaces prominently.</p>
          <u><strong>Effect of over-censoring on movie plots:</strong></u>
          <p>Both the movies listed above were rated “A” and yet they had these expletives muted. Experiencing sudden and unexpected silence on screen is extremely distracting and makes the plot hard to follow. “A” rated movies should have minimal changes and the CBFC should not mute words, delete visuals of violence and nudity. CBFC should stop treating adult movies with kid gloves.</p>
          <p>The recent controversy regarding trimming a kissing scene from the new James bond movie Spectre is a case in point. This movie was rated “U/A” and the CBFC recommended 50% removal of a kissing scene. Would the CBFC do the same had that particular scene been twice as long? Doesn't it give an impetus to movie makers to have even more of these titillating scenes on the assumption that at least 50% will go through the certification process? This whole process of hard limits on certain scenes defies logic. If CBFC doesn't have a problem with kissing, why not accept the whole scene?</p>
          <p>The CBFC urgently needs to follow a single set of standards for all movies to avoid always being mired in controversy.  Having certain set standards will make it easier for creators to know what to expect before they start making the film so that they can exercise due diligence during the creative process. There is more drama created by CBFC than most of the movies today!</p>
